# Tour-Bus-Ticket-Booking-System-C-
Developed a CLI-based ticket booking application to manage tour buses with features such as adding new buses, viewing schedules, and searching by bus ID.

➤ Implemented using Object-Oriented Programming and file handling for persistent data storage (binary files).

➤ Designed an interactive menu-driven interface to simulate real-world bus booking operations.

➤ Utilized C++ concepts such as classes, arrays, and I/O streams to build a robust application.
